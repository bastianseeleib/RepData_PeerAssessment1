## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
activityNoNA <- na.omit(activity)
byDay <- activityNoNA %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(dailySteps = sum(steps))
p <- ggplot(byDay, aes(x=dailySteps)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)
print(p)
```

The mean steps per day, excluding NA values, are xxx steps.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
